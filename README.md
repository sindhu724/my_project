## Features

### 1. Algorithm Visualization
- Visualize the working of various sorting and searching algorithms such as:
  - Sorting
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
  - Searching
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search
    - Ternary Search
    
### 2. User Control
- Adjust the speed of the visualization:
  - Slow
  - Normal
  - Fast
- Pause or Reset the visualization process.

### 3. Custom Input
- Users can input the length of an array to visualize the process.

### 4. Algorithm Complexity
- Displays the time and space complexity of the selected algorithm (Worst, Average, and Best cases).
- Provide a seperate example for each complexity case.

### 5. Code Snippets
- Provides example code for each algorithm in:
  - C
  - Java
  - Python
